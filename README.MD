## Requirements : 
 
* i.  Provide the value for PAYU_MERCHANT_KEY in .env file. (The value for MERCHANT_KEY will be provided after the onboarding process is completed).
      
## Installation steps:

* i. PayU integration can be done in two stages (staging and production modes).
           staging and production modes have different PayU transaction urls and Merchant key.

ii. In staging mode we are using sandbox details for testing the payU working.
       
       Staging mode transaction url 
       https://test.payu.in/_payment
        
iii. If you are using production mode means it accepts original details of payU. 
  
        Production mode transaction url    
        https://secure.payu.in/_payment
